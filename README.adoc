* This is a desktop Address Book + Task Management application.
* One of our primary aims is to allow users to quickly and effectively manage their group projects.
* Cow has an extremely simple GUI that gets out of the way and lets you immerse yourself in the work that needs to be done.
* Our command line driven user interface allows you to achieve maximum productivity. Your fingers never need to leave the keyboard.

////
* It is a Java sample application intended for students learning Software Engineering while using Java as the main programming language.
* It is *written in OOP fashion*. It provides a *reasonably well-written* code example that is *significantly bigger* (around 6 KLoC)than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules.
* What's different from https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3[level 3]:
** A more sophisticated GUI that includes a list  panel and an in-built Browser.
** More test cases, including automated GUI testing.
** Support for _Build Automation_ using Gradle and for _Continuous Integration_ using Travis CI.
